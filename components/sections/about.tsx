          “Each new day, each new experience inspires me.” Art is a conversation for Jay Karun. The canvas is where his
          mind makes its most eloquent remarks. His observations on the canvas are a window to his forthright and
          thoughtful mind, reflecting his profound observation, passion, and compassion for nature and the human
          predicament.

          Nature has been the biggest inspiration and medium for his work at all times. Elements from nature often form
          his language. Drawing a spark from commonplace sights, Jay Karun weaves a profound story on his canvas. When a
          thought strikes him, he lets it settle for a day and then gives it form on canvas.

          His style leans toward impressionism. The depth of colours in his work can be attributed to this, and to his
          enthusiastic perspective toward life and art. Jay Karun loves interacting with fellow artists and is greatly
          influenced by masters like Oskar Kokoschka.
